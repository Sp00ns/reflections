What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty repository with no commits is created in the directory you run git init.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area only contains files you have chosen to commit. For a myriad of reasons you may not wish to add every file in a working directory to a commit.
